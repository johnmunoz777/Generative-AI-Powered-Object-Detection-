## ðŸŽ¯ Executive Summary

This repository contains the implementation of an Motorcycle Compliance Object Detection Model. <br>
We developed an automated compliance monitoring system capable of real-time detection of safety violations. <br>
We utilized real-world data as well as synthetic video data generated with Googleâ€™s Veo 2 and Veo 3 models  <br>


### ðŸ“Š Key Achievement
- **81% mAP50** accuracy achieved through hybrid synthetic-real data approach
- **86% precision** in detecting safety compliance violations
- **Real-time processing** capability for traffic monitoring systems

# ðŸš¨ Problem Statement

In April of 2025, Peru passed a new law requiring all motorcycle operators must wear certified helmets and reflective vests displaying license plate numbers.
Manual enforcement presents significant challenges:

- Resource-intensive manual inspections
- Limited scalability for nationwide coverage
- Inconsistent enforcement across regions
- Delayed response to violations

### ðŸ’¡ Our Solution
An automated detection system utilizing synthetic data generation to overcome data scarcity challenges while maintaining high accuracy in real-world deployments.
