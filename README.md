## ðŸŽ¯ Executive Summary

This repository contains the implementation of an Motorcycle Compliance Object Detection Model. <br>
We developed an automated compliance monitoring system capable of real-time detection of safety violations. <br>
We utilized real-world data as well as synthetic video data generated with Googleâ€™s Veo 2 and Veo 3 models  <br>


### ðŸ“Š Key Achievement
- **81% mAP50** accuracy achieved through hybrid synthetic-real data approach
- **86% precision** in detecting safety compliance violations
- **Real-time processing** capability for traffic monitoring systems
